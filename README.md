This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I also tried to use React Hooks in this project (cuz it's cool ;) ), so the code might look a bit different 

Note: You might encounter blocking popup errors when trying to authenticate, please turn off blocking popup in your browser to run the app
